```
Input A, B // A and B are real variables
A = A - B
C = A * 2
Output C // C is a real variable
```


## Task 1
- show all possible mistakes/faulty in the program
- show how to distinguish between a good and bad/buggy ones

## Task 2
- show if the test case(s) can help identify the "good" ones

## Task 3
- give a test case (specifications of variable values)

## p.24
- if test cases cannot achieve the testing objective compare the performance of both test cases to see how many bad programs can it filter out.
